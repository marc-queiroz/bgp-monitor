## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine ‚â• 24.0
- Docker Compose ‚â• 2.23
- 4GB RAM + 2 CPU cores recommended

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marc-queiroz/bgp-monitor.git
cd bgp-monitor

# Start services
docker-compose up -d --build

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Configuration

1. Edit `src/collector.py`:
```python
PEER_ASNS = {"9002"}  # Set target ASNs
RIS_CLIENT_ID = "my-bgp-client-v1"  # Custom client identifier
```

2. Rebuild containers after changes:
```bash
docker-compose build collector
```

## API Endpoints üåê

| Endpoint                | Description                          | Example                      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `GET /peer/{asn}`       | Get all prefixes for an ASN          | `/peer/327804`               |
| `GET /prefix/{prefix}`  | Find peers announcing a prefix       | `/prefix/146.158.92.0/23`    |
| `GET /origin/{asn}`     | Get prefixes originated by an ASN    | `/origin/213499`             |
| `GET /all`              | Get complete BGP table snapshot      | `/all`                       |

### Example Usage

```bash
# Get current prefixes for AS327804
curl http://localhost:8000/peer/327804

# Find origin of specific prefix
curl http://localhost:8000/origin/213499
```

## Development üõ†Ô∏è

### VS Code Setup

1. Install [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
2. Open project folder
3. `F1` > **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container**

### Common Commands

```bash
# Access Redis CLI
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli

# Access MongoDB Shell
docker-compose exec mongodb mongosh -u root -p example

# Run tests
docker-compose exec api pytest tests/
```

## Data Model üì¶

### Redis Structure
```python
"bgp:peer:{ASN}": {
    "prefix": {
        "as_path": [ASN1, ASN2,...],
        "communities": ["ASN:VAL",...],
        "timestamp": 1739654067.8
    }
}
```

### MongoDB Schema
```javascript
{
  prefix: "146.158.92.0/23",
  as_path: [327804, 6939, 35598, 58002, 213499],
  origin_as: 213499,
  peer_asn: "327804",
  communities: [],
  announcement: true,
  timestamp: ISODate("2025-02-15T17:15:67Z")
}
```
